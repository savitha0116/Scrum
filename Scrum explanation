                     Scrum 
Scrum is a lightweight, agile framework used to develop, deliver, and maintain complex products—especially in software development. It focuses on teamwork, collaboration, iterative progress, and continuous improvement.
Scrum helps teams work in short cycles, deliver small increments of work frequently, and get regular feedback. It emphasizes adaptability and quick response to change rather than following a rigid plan.
1. Empirical Process Control: Make decisions based on observation and experimentation.
2. Self-Organization: Teams organize themselves to achieve goals.
3. Collaboration: Collaboration between team members and stakeholders.
4. Value-Based Prioritization: Prioritize work based on business value.
5. Time-Boxing: Work is organized into fixed-length iterations (sprints).
6. Iterative Development: Deliver working software in iterations.
